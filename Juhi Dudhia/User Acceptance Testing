User Acceptance Testing Explained
When a customer requests a new feature, 
it enters the SDLC. Once developed and added to the system, 
the new feature will typically go through the four levels of testing: unit testing – performed by developers,
integration testing and system testing – performed by someone on the QA team, and finally, acceptance testing – performed by either a stakeholder, someone who has requested the new feature, someone who will use the new feature, or someone who represents one of the users.

UAT Testing Examples
To make the topic clearer, let’s use some examples.
Imagine working on an e-commerce project for a brick-and-mortar clothing store.
The website carries advertisements sponsored by local third-party restaurants
One of the restaurants has requested a new feature that offers shoppers a promo code when they view the restaurant’s site through the advertisement on your site. In this scenario, once the feature has been developed and tested by your team, someone from the restaurant would perform UAT to ensure the new feature satisfies their request.

Purpose of UAT?
Business Requirements must be available
Need to to fully develop Application Code
Ensure you complete Unit Testing, Integration Testing & System Testing
No Show stoppers, or High or Medium defects in the System Integration Test Phase
Only Cosmetic errors are acceptable before UAT
Complete Regression Testing with no major defects
Ensure you fix and test all the defects reports
Complete traceability matrix for all testing
UAT Environment must be ready
Sign off mail or communication from System Testing Team that the system is ready for UAT execution
