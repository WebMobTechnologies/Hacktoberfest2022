# 5 REASONS TO INVEST IN USER EXPERIENCE

There's still an element of ambiguity around the financial returns of user experience design. This may be due to the amount of time it takes for a UX-led approach to “pay off”, the relative newness of the field, and awareness about UX design in the mainstream.
But companies that don't invest in this space will quickly be overtaken by user-centric competitors.

## 1 - You can spend less money on web development 

Researchers found that developers spend 50% of their time fixing projects. Think of it this way: 50% of her developer salary is wasted fixing bugs that her UX design process should have eliminated in previous iterations. "The developer spends her 50% of her time fixing the project."
For companies that invest in UX, developers spend time on projects that don't require changes, resulting in faster product releases.

## 2 - Increase sales

A 2016 design study found that the more companies invested in design, the more revenue they generated. Dubbed a “design unicorn,” the company with the most investment in his UX saw his revenue grow by 75%. Even companies that invest less in UX (those that simply think of themselves as “design-centric”) saw a 60% increase in revenue.

## 3 - Build customer loyalty and increase word of mouth

According to the study, customer experience will overtake price and product as a key product differentiator in the next three years. Successful companies are the ones that put their customers first and deliver great experiences. There is a reason for this. Satisfied customers don't just spend money to return products, they become loyal users by recommending products to their friends. Business Review found that satisfied customers are more likely to recommend products to friends through word of mouth. His 23% of customers who had a positive experience told 10 or more people about it. This is free advertising from a trusted source, and all because the company's goals align with those of its users.

##  4 - Get more business intelligence

Information is your greatest asset. Making well-informed business decisions can be difficult, so business intelligence can be essential. A good UX gives you the freedom to collect as much of this information as possible to ensure your users get their money's worth. You can optimize your UX performance with some useful business intelligence tools.
